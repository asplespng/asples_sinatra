Helpers for basic Sinatra applications.
Currently a helper for generating bootstrap formatted input fields for ActiveRecord objects.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'asples_sinatra'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install asples_sinatra

## Usage
E.g. in your app.rb
```ruby
require 'asples_sinatra'
```

E.g. using haml
```ruby
@user = OpenStruct.new #could also be an active record object.
@user.errors = {name: ["An error has occured"]}
@user.name = "John Doe"

haml "= input :name, object: @user, label: 'Full name', placeholder: 'Enter your full name'"
```
This outputs

```html
<div class="form-group has-error">
  <label class="control-label" for="name">Full name:</label>
  <input class="form-control" name="name" placeholder="Enter your full name" type="text" value="John Doe">
